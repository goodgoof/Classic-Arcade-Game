## Instructions

Welcome to the Classic Arcade Game. This game is all about speed and how you can beat the bugs and reach the river.

Are you ready....lets get started. On the game board is a cute little girl called TopGirl :). You have to help her reach the river without being bitten by the bugs. Can you help her...

The arrow keys on the keyboard will help you move side to side. One tab on the arrow key moves the TopGirl one block to the top, right, bottom or left. Only the arrow keys will take you to the river. My suggestion is that you first watch the bugs and how fast or slow they are moving on the board and accordingly make your move.

Once you reach the river, a modal will pop up indicating that you have won.On the popup window you have to option to play the game again.

So good luck and enjoy the game.
